# transshipment

Game I made for this game jam: https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-50-islands

# How to compile on Linux?

Install libSDL2-dev, libSDL2-image-dev, libSDL2-ttf-dev and libSDL2-mixer-dev. Clone the repository and run

> make transshipment

To run the program, do

> ./bin/transshipment

If it complains about some directories, just create them. Probably you will have to create

> obj

> obj/game

> bin

# Things used

SDL2.0, SDL_image, SDL_mixer and SDL_ttf
